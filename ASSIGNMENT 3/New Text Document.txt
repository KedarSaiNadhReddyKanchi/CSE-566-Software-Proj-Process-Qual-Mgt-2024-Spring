Project Narrative
Project Title: Smart Home Climate Control System (SHCCS)

Project Description:
The Smart Home Climate Control System (SHCCS) is an embedded system designed to automate and optimize the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) of a residential space. It aims to provide a comfortable living environment for occupants while maximizing energy efficiency. The system will integrate with various sensors and actuators to monitor and control temperature, humidity, and air quality. It will also feature a user-friendly interface for manual control and will be capable of learning from user preferences and environmental conditions to adjust settings automatically.

Project Size with Justification:
The project is estimated to be of medium to large size due to several factors:

Complexity: The system involves integrating various hardware components and sensors, requiring sophisticated software algorithms for climate control and energy optimization.
Functionality: The SHCCS will offer a range of features, including automatic adjustment, user preference learning, and remote control via a mobile app.
Integration: The system needs to be compatible with existing HVAC systems and smart home platforms, adding to the development complexity.
