MODE	: embedded
"A" variable	: 	2.3786877986470945
"B" variable	: 	1.2
"C" variable	: 	2.5
"D" variable	:	0.32
KLOC	:		85.000
EFFORT, (in person-months)	: 491.632
DURATION, (in months)	:	18.166
STAFFING, (recommended): 	27.063


Explanation: The coefficients are set according to the project mode selected on the previous page, (as per Boehm). Note: the decimal separator is a period.
The final estimates are determined in the following manner:

effort = a*KLOCb, in person-months, with KLOC = lines of code, (in thousands), and:

staffing = effort/duration

where a has been adjusted by the factors:
